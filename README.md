# GrowTower

A minimalist, vertical grow tower designed for home cannabis cultivation. This project focuses on space efficiency, ease of use, and effective odor control, making it perfect for beginners and small living spaces.

## Features

- **Vertical Grow System:** Maximizes vertical space usage.
- **Integrated Odor Control:** Features a custom-designed activated carbon filter housing.
- **Silent & Efficient Cooling:**  Uses a standard Arctic P14 generic PC fan for both airflow and cooling.
- **Minimalist Design:** clean aesthetics that blend into a modern home environment.
- **Beginner Friendly:**  Simple assembly and maintenance. Hard to make mistakes.
- **3D Printable:**  Most structural components are designed to be 3D printed.

## How it Works

The GrowTower utilizes a forced-air system where the Arctic P14 fan pulls air through the tower, ensuring fresh CO2 for the plant and maintaining optimal temperatures. The air is then pushed through an activated carbon filter before exiting, neutralizing any odors. The vertical stacking design allows for modularity and easy height adjustment as the plant grows.

## Getting Started

See [BOM.md](BOM.md) for a full list of materials required to build your own GrowTower.

## Internal Sieve Printing Instructions

The Internal Sieve model is intentionally designed to be "closed". To print it correctly:

1.  **Open the Sieve:** In your slicer, use a modifier to remove the top and bottom solid layers.
2.  **Create the Mesh:** Set the infill density to approximately **30%** and use a **Rectilinear** pattern. This generates the necessary mesh structure for the filter.

## How it Works

The GrowTower utilizes a forced-air system where the Arctic P14 fan pulls air through the tower, ensuring fresh CO2 for the plant and maintaining optimal temperatures. The air is then pushed through an activated carbon filter before exiting, neutralizing any odors. The vertical stacking design allows for modularity and easy height adjustment as the plant grows.
